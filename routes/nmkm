Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up Postman for testing and documenting Swifthayaâ€™s API:

Step 1: Install Postman
Download and install Postman on your computer.
Step 2: Create a New Collection
Open Postman, click on Collections on the left sidebar, then click the New Collection button.
Name it something like Swifthaya API.
Step 3: Add Your First API Endpoint
Click the "Add Request" button inside your new collection.
Set the Request Type:
For example, choose POST, GET, PUT, or DELETE depending on the endpoint.
Enter the API URL:
Enter the full URL for the API endpoint. For instance, http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/login for the login endpoint.
Set the Request Body:
If the endpoint expects a payload (e.g., POST), go to the Body tab and choose raw or form-data depending on how the API accepts data.
Example for a login API:
json
Copy code
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}
Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
In Postman, environment variables allow you to avoid hardcoding values like the base URL or API key.
Click on the gear icon (top-right) and select Manage Environments.
Create a New Environment called "Swifthaya Local" (or another name that fits your workflow).
Add Variables:
Base URL: Set a variable like {{base_url}} and assign it http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/.
Token: Add a token variable for your API keys, if needed.
